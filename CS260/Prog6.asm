; Assignment # 6
; Version of Visual Studio used:2015
; Did program compile? Yes
; Did program produce correct results? Yes
;
; Estimate of time in hours to complete assignment: 5
;
; Short description of what program does: This program implements a series of math functions made 
; to show how one can use bitmap addressing and unsigned math to evaluate a series of numbers.  
; It uses a while loop and macros to display the results obtained by the math functions.
;
; *************************************************************
;
; Reminder: each assignment should be the result of your
; individual effort with no collaboration with other students.
;
; Reminder: every line of code must be commented and formatted
; per the ProgramExpectations.pdf file on the class web site
